This repository contains supporting data, code and analysis for our recent manuscript on predicting rodent hepatotoxicity using chemical structure and bioactivity data ([J. Liu, K. Mansouri, R. S. Judson, M. T. Martin, H. Hong, M. Chen, X. Xu, R. S. Thomas, and I. Shah, “Predicting hepatotoxicity using ToxCast in vitro bioactivity and chemical structure,” Chem. Res. Toxicol., vol. 28, no. 4, pp. 738–751, Apr. 2015](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/tx500501h)). We implemented the machine learning approach described in this manuscript using Python and by relying extensively on the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package. The analysis was conducted in an ipython notebook (now called jupyter).
